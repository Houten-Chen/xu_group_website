Proposed new Xu Group Website Layout

TODO:
- add pictures of Andrew and Gautam
- update project descriptions if yours currently are not correct, if you didn't have a project description on the old website I just put down your subgroup name
- Update the "what we do" on home page and the entire "Research" page - currently out of date.
- If you want your name to link to your linkedIn or personal website, send it to me and I can add it.
- add missing undergrads who want to be on the website
- New group photo!
- Can someone send me a picture of the stick figure drawing someone made of our group, and any other images you have that I can put on the website to give it some personality.
- Transfer alumni to new page (for now the link just goes to the old website's alumni page)
- Finish adding publications 1-49 (for now there is just a link at the bottom to the old publications page)
